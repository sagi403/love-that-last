      <h4 className="mt-5">LTL's Mission</h4>
      <p>
        As lovers, we realized we struggled to find other stores that sold
        quality products that talk about love while offering fast, friendly
        service. That is why we created LTL. We have made it our mission to
        provide all of our customers with the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A range of the highest quality products.</li>
        <li>
          A focus on innovative products that are not available in every store.
        </li>
        <li>Customer centric support that is fast, friendly and efficient.</li>
        <li>And of course… extremely low prices!</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="mt-5">Why Choose LTL?</h4>
      <p>
        When you shop with us, you’ll see the LTL difference. We are focused on
        finding unique products that you won’t find at your local store. One of
        our most popular products, Love Knot necklace with a message card is a
        fantastic example of this! From necklace with a message card to personal
        design necklace (coming soon) and more, we have you covered!
      </p>
