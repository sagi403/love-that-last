        Fulfillment time doesn't include shipping. To get an idea of how long an
        order will take to reach its destination, combine the estimated
        fulfillment time with the estimated shipping time. Fulfillment for large

        International orders, we use UPS or USPS, both use the equivalent First
        Class International service. Once the package has landed in the
        destination country, it is delivered by the domestic mail carrier in
        that country.
